  <p>Lockbit is one of the largest ransomeware groups in the world, in doing so they (actually the affiliates) hack companies to then get money through ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malware that infects your computer and encrypts all files, after which it asks for a ransom that must then be paid for a decryption key.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>This group was hacked a few days ago due to a security flaw in the website(s). We are talking about a flaw in PHP, lockbit had used an older version of the software which led to the website being taken over. Lockbit himself has posted a response to this takeover on his new site where he says they did this because they did not want information about <a href="https://fultoncountyga.gov/">https://fultoncountyga.gov/</a> to be leaked. He further said that the information will still be leaked.</p>
<p><img src="/images/OPCRO1.png" alt="Pic2"></p>
<p>The governments had also changed the website, here you could see that for example all the &ldquo;leaks&rdquo; were changed by self-made posts by them. Also the logo was changed by putting a sticker with &ldquo;seized&rdquo; on it, and a lot more, all this to “bully” lockbit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/OPCRO2.png" alt="Pic1"></p>
<p>After 4 days, lockbitsupp had already put new sites online so that all the data could be downloaded and viewed again. He also said that it took 4 days because there was incompatible code for the newer versions of PHP and so those parts had to be changed as well.</p>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>What do we learn from this? Always use the latest version of the software, that way you avoid security flaws in your systems and the authorities don&rsquo;t hijack your site.Document Title</p>
